Deleting (Remove) from a BST 
	-Running time O(h)

1. Determine withether the node is in the tree. Something like contains()
2. No child => Node can be removed outright 
3. One Child => Node is replaced with its child node
4. Two Children => Find the minimum node in the right sub tree and replace the node with that min node in order to maintain the BST property

Tree Traversal 

1.Depth-First Traversal
	-Pre-Order: Process = root, left subtree, right subtree
	-In-Order: Left Subtree, root right subtree
	-Post-Order Left, right, root 
2. Breadth-First Traversal
	-Level-Order 

print_tree(t)
	if t == None: 
		return t

	if t.left != None:
		print_tree(t.left)
	print(t.value)

	if t.right != None: 
		print(t.right)
